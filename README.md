# Westeros Currency Exchange
## For A Song of Ice and Fire RPG

A bloody simple tool for converting the many, many different Westerosi coin denominations into other coins.

For example:

> I want to buy a badass Destier (1000ss) and some leather barding (1,100ss) > and apparently I have 15gb in my purse... Is that enough?
> Yep, 15gp == 3150ss.

Enjoy.
